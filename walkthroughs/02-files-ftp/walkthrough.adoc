== Content-Based Router introduction

Content-Based Router (CBR) is a pattern from the link:https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com[Enterprise Integration Patterns, window="_blank"]. You will use CBR when you need to filter some result and send to a different target based in the filter criteria.

The code below is a CBR sample from the Enterprise Integration Pattern website.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .choice()
        .when(header("type").isEqualTo("widget"))
            .to("direct:widget")
        .when(header("type").isEqualTo("gadget"))
            .to("direct:gadget")
        .otherwise()
            .to("direct:other")
----

You will use similar code in this lab.

=== Separating different types of Orders

We are continuing to evolve the previous lab. We have five orders being generated automatically by the last lab. In each order generated the item description is different, alternating between *ActiveMQ* and *Camel*.

Let's separate each of these different books with content-based router pattern. But first, let's update the previous router to invoke the one that we will be working on this lab.

Add this line to the previous lab:

    .to("direct:book-to-file");

It must result in the following code

[source,java]
----
from("timer:generate?repeatCount=5&period=1000")
    .log("Generating Order...")
    .bean(OrderService.class, "generateOrder")
    .log("Order ${body.item} generated")
.to("direct:book-to-file");
----

Now, let's implement the Content-Based Router pattern:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:book-to-file")
    .choice()
        .when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
            .log("Processing a Camel book")
        .otherwise()
            .log("Processing an ActiveMQ book");
----

We compare the *item* attribute of the object Order and print a message.

Run the integration.

image::./images/02-camel-cbr-01.png[]

[type=verification]
Do you see both messages *Processing a Camel book* and *Processing an ActiveMQ book* in the log?

[time=5]
== Interacting with Files

https://camel.apache.org/file.html[window="_blank"]

Let's use a new *File* component to persist this order on the filesystem. The *File* component is powerful and enables us to interact with the file system easily.

Adjust the route to persist the Camel book in the directory `/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel` and the ActiveMQ book in  `/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq`

image::./images/lab02-filesystem.png[]

See the code below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:book-to-file")
    .choice()
        .when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
            .log("Processing a camel book")
            .convertBodyTo(String.class)
            .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel")
        .otherwise()
            .log("Processing an activemq book")
            .convertBodyTo(String.class)
            .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq");
----

The line `.convertBodyTo(String.class)` is just invoking the `toString` method on the `Order` class. After that we are saving all files to the filesystem.

Run the integration and check if the files were saved. 
To check if the file was save, we are going to list the files of the `/tmp/fuse-workshop` directory.

{empty} +

To open the terminal, click on `Terminal` on the top menu, then `Open terminal in a specific Container` and select `tools`.

Do you see the files inside the `/tmp/fuse-workshop` directories?

But wait, look at file names! They are auto-generated and weird! Let's fix these exploring some parameters of the file component.

Change the last line as the following:

Camel:

    .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel?fileName=camel-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.txt")

ActiveMQ

    .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq?fileName=activemq-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.txt");

Run the integration


image::./images/lab02-file-pretty-names.png[]

[type=verification]
Do you see the files with the new patterns?

[time=10]
== Data Transformation

https://camel.apache.org/data-format.html

Now, let's take the example before and instead of storing everything in *.txt* format, let's transform the Java object in the Camel body (`Order.java`).

Let's transform the Camel type to JSON and the ActiveMQ to XML.

image::./images/lab02-content-base-router.png[]

To work with Data Format, we have two methods: *marshall()* and *unmarshal()*.

* *marshall()* we use to convert a Java Bean in other datatype as XML, JSON, CSV, etc
* *unmarshal()* we use to the opposite when we have a datatype as XML, JSON, CSV, etc, and would like to transform into a Java Bean

Let's remove the transformation of the body to `String` and do a proper transformation.

Update the route to the following:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:book-to-file")
    .choice()
        .when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
            .log("Processing a camel book")
            .marshal().json()
            .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel?fileName=camel-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.json")
        .otherwise()
            .log("Processing an activemq book")
            .marshal().jacksonxml()
            .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq?fileName=activemq-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.xml");
----

Run the integration

image::./images/lab02-file-pretty-names-2.png[]

[type=verification]
Do you see the files with the correct extensions? Is the content of each file what you would expect?

[time=10]
=== Processor and Transformation

Let's add some adrenaline to it! Let's change the `Order` attribute `processed` to `true` for ActiveMQ books prior to doing the upload to the FTP server.

image::./images/lab02-process-diagram.png[]

One way to do it is by using a `Processor`. With a `Processor`, you can have total control with the message and headers being sent through the Camel pipeline.

Let's create a process, capture `Order` object on the Camel body, and change the attribute `process` to *`true`*.

Open the `OrderProcessor.java` file, and implement the logic to change the attribute `processed` of the `Order` object.

[source,java]
----
public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    Order order = exchange.getIn().getBody(Order.class);
    order.setProcessed(true);
    System.out.println("attributed process changed");
    exchange.getOut().setBody(order);
}
----

image::./images/lab02-processor.png[]

And in the route, add the process before the first transformation of ActiveMQ books.
[source,java]
----
from("direct:book-to-file")
    .choice()
        .when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
            .log("Processing a camel book")
            .marshal().json()
            .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel?fileName=camel-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.json")
        .otherwise()
            .log("Processing an activemq book")
            .process(new OrderProcessor()) // ADD THIS LINE
            .marshal().jacksonxml()
            .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq?fileName=activemq-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.xml");
----

image::./images/lab02-processor2.png[]

Run the integration.

[type=verification]
Do you see the last XML files generated with the process attribute is true?

[time=10]
== FTP Server (SKIP THIS LAB - CURRENTLY NOT WORKING)

Now, let's create another route to upload those files to an FTP server. The FTP server credentials will be provided by the instructor during the class.

Implement a route that takes all files in the camel directory and publishes it in the FTP server.

image::./images/lab02-ftp-server-diagram.png[]

* FTP Host: `<FTP HOST>`
* FTP Username: `{user-username}`
* FTP Password: `<FTP PASSWORD>`
* FTP Directory: `/var/fuse-workshop/{user-username}`

Also, remember to configure the component to *delete the files* after being consumed.

The sample for the camel directory would be:

[source,java,subs="attributes"]
----
from("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel?delete=true")
    .log("Uploading camel orders to ftp")
    .to("ftp://{user-username}@##ftp-host##?password=##ftp-password##");
----

Do the same with the files on the camel directory.

Run the integration.

image::./images/lab02-filezilla-files.png[]

[type=verification]
Do you see the files uploaded to FTP server? Were they also removed from the filesystem?

*Just as an additional note*

If you would like to consume files from FTP and work with them as Java Objects, you would use the `unmarshal()` method instead of `marshal()`. See an example:

[source,java]
----
    .log("reading files from ftp")
    .unmarshal().jacksonxml(Order.class) // Transform the file to Java Object
----
